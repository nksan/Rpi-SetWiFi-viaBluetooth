"""
note to self:
it is worth remebering that Python passes objects to function by assignment to names.  
if the name is re-bound within the function to something else, then the initial object is never modified.
so if x=2 is passed, 2 is an immutable object anyway so x=x+1 insidethe function has not modified 2 which is named x outside the function
but if x is a mutable object ie. it has attributes that can be changed, - like my wpa_network class with attributes, 
    if I pass x to a function, the function can change the attributes of x without reassigning the name "x" to something else,
    so x.locked = False for example, means the attribute "locked" has changed in the object named x - outside the function
    (Python did not make a copy of the object).
In particular if I pass a single Wpa_Network items (object) from the wpa_list dictionary to a function, and the function modifies it's attributes,
then the dictionary that contains the object will see that this object's attributes have changed.
Furthermore, if I assign a name to one of the of the dictionary items, and proceed to modify this name.attributes,
the item inside the dictionary is changed as well - since both the new name and the dictionary hold a reference to the same object:
connected_network = wpa.wpa_supplicant_ssids['ssid']
connected_network.disabled = False
will find that wpa.wpa.wpa_supplicant_ssids['ssid'] object has not its disabled attribute set to False.

    object describing the network in the wpa_supplicant_file - as it is saved on disk
    it should be managed to always represent what is saved on disk.
    Note: conflict is not saved on disk per se:
        it is a flag that indicates that the lock status what is saved on disk is different 
        than what is seen by the rpi scan 
            i.e.: ssid is locked on disk file but an ssid of the same name is braodcasting as open network.

    Conflicts:
    A conflict exists when a known network stored in the RPi has a given encryption status (ex: Locked/psk) 
        but the current scan shows a different encryption status (ex: open) 
        the ios app will received the scanned value (here open) - but the known network will attempt to connect 
        using the sotred information (in this case locked: psk - password).
    this basically means that the status of the network was changed on the router since the user last connected to it.
    Rather than try to manage all cases of conflicts - the code does simply this:
        - if a conflict between scann vs stored network is found 
            - the stored network is deleted
            - the network is added to the list of unknown networks for the user to reconnect, 
                at which point it will be shown a password box on the ios app, adn the user can enter the password
                (or if open, the connection will be establish by simply clicking on it.)
            - special case for hidden ssid:  hidden ssid once connected to are part of the known networks and can be scanned.
                If found to be in conflict - the known network is deleted from the RPi, 
                but it will continue to appear in thge unknown network list - since it was scanned,
                for as long as the app is connected by bluetooth to the RPi.
                If user exists app and restart - it will no longer be found and will have to be re-connected to by entering both ssid and password
                like any hidden ssid.
